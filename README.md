# ðŸ˜´ Drowsiness Detection Using dlib ðŸ¤–

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a system to detect signs of driver drowsiness using dlibâ€™s landmark detection shape_predictor utility. The system is designed to identify drowsiness indicators such as closed eyes, yawning, and head movements using a custom dataset. The ultimate goal is to enhance driver safety by providing timely alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Performance Analysis
### Training and Testing Accuracy
- **Training Accuracy**: The custom dlib shape predictor model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.66 during training, indicating a good ability to detect drowsiness-related facial features.
- **Testing Accuracy**: The model's performance on the test set yielded an MAE of 7.19, which is higher than desired for robust detection. This discrepancy highlights the need for further model optimization to effectively capture the complexity of drowsiness indicators.

### Insights
The relatively high testing error suggests that the model struggles with the diversity of drowsiness indicators, such as varied eye gaze directions and yawning. Improving the model's accuracy in these areas is crucial for real-world application in driver monitoring scenarios.
